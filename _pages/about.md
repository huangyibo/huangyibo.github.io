I am now a Postdoc Associate in [CS](https://cs.rice.edu/) at [RICE University](https://www.rice.edu/) working closely with [Prof. Ang Chen](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~angchen/).
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Fudan University, co-advised by [Prof. Jie Wu](https://dblp.org/pid/w/JieWu3.html), [Prof. Yang Xu](https://yangxu.info/) and [Prof. Zhihui Lv](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/3f/5e/c25895a278366/page.htm) in Dec. 2021.
Prior to joining FDU, I received B.S. in Software Engineering from Central South University in Jun. 2016.

My research interests mainly lie in the fields of Distributed System, Networked System and Data Center Network.
In particular, I focus on the system design, development and optimization about RDMA-enhanced datacenter systems, eBPF systems, OS security, network protocol stack and RPC.
